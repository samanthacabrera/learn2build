## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samanthacabrera/learn2build.git
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd learn2build
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up enviornment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Mapbox API token and Clerk keys.
   ```
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api_key
   ```
4. Start frontend server:

Before accessing the application, make sure that both the backend and frontend servers are running. Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This URL will load the Recipe Roots platform where you can interact with the application.
